### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Github for my interesting projects, often used in my YouTube tutorials.  
My primary interest is machine learning. From basic statistics, data visualization to complex neural networks.  
I also like to make some cool stuff(games, visualization, etc.) when I have an idea for them.
